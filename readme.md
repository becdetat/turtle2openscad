# Turtle2OpenSCAD

Client-side web app that converts a small Turtle script into OpenSCAD `polygon(points=[...])` output.

## Features

- 3 panes: Turtle script editor (Monaco), animated preview (Play/Pause), generated OpenSCAD output (read-only) with Copy button
- Turtle defaults: origin `(0, 0)`, heading up, degrees, pen down
- Supports multiple polygons via `PU`/`PD`
- Pen-up travel is shown dashed in the preview

## Turtle language

- Separators: newline and `;`
- Comments: `# ...` and `// ...` (to end of line)
- Numbers: decimals and negative values allowed
- Commands (long + short aliases):
	- `FD` / `FORWARD <n>`
	- `BK` / `BACK <n>`
	- `LT` / `LEFT <deg>`
	- `RT` / `RIGHT <deg>`
	- `PU` / `PENUP`
	- `PD` / `PENDOWN`
